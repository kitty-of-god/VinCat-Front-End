## Things to be developed on the next iteration:
* **Improve UI components' style.** On this iteration we were more focused on the behaviour of all the components and how they interacted between each other. The next step is to work on the UI look-and-feel.

*  **Shopping cart component.** For the next iteration, we will work on the shopping cart component. The user must be able to select any available product, and all of them should appear on the shopping cart with their prices and info.

* **Search products in the search bar.** Right now the search has no interactivity. For the next iteration the users should be able to search products by similar words in their names. We shall expand the search bar functionality (search by item, gender, etc.) in posterious iterations.

* **Like a product.** The user shall be able to "like" a product through a button integrated in each product card.

* **View another user's "closet".**    The users should be able to see the products another user is selling condensed in a single page, the user's "closet".
